# Sanbercode-Data-Science-Project
This project is a final project that I have to do as a condition for passing the Sanbercode training. My job is to carry out several directions ranging from Exploratory Data Analysis to the formation of Machine Learning models to predict an employee's salary based on age, last education, marital status, and many more.
